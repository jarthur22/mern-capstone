# Senior Capstone: A Self-Descriptive MERN Fullstack Web Application
#### by Jacob Arthur

Welcome to my Senior Capstone Project for Holy Family University! My name is Jacob Arthur, and I'm a CIS major, Class of 2021.

## What this project entails:

### MERN Stack Web App

MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Nodejs) is a very popular stack for fullstack web development. It is 100% written using Javascript. The backend is an Express/Nodejs server that gets data from MongoDB Atlas, the standard MongoDB cloud database service. The server serves up the frontend, which is a single-page web app built with the React.js framework. State management is handled with Redux and styling is done using Bootstrap/Reactstrap. Data is served to the frontend dynamically using a REST API and, partially, Websockets (for educational purposes). The project is hosted in the cloud using Heroku. Version control and deployment is handled with Git/Github.

### MERN Stack Overview

This web app isn't just a fullstack MERN app-- it's self-descriptive! As you explore the site, you'll see the architecture of the fullstack app and exactly how it functions in a comprehensive step-by-step guide.

### A Brief History of Javascript, from ECMA to All-Purpose Frameworks

My professor wanted this :P but, Javascript has a very interesting history and can do some amazing things with web technologies! Enjoy!
