### An Overview of Styling

There are many ways to implement styles with Javascript and React, but for this project, I prefer to use React-Bootstrap (Reactstrap) and Bootswatch, plus some custom styles with simple site-wide CSS.

#### Reactstrap

React-Bootstrap, or Reactstrap, is a library of custom components for React that implement Bootstrap CSS designs. These components, when compiled, transform into elements with the Bootstrap classes that you may already be familiar with.

#### Bootswatch

Bootswatch is a series of custom Bootstrap themes. Using a Bootswatch theme via CDN in your `index.html` file allows you to apply a Bootswatch theme to your entire application. Implementing these themes makes it easier to quickly build a React frontend.

#### Custom CSS

In order to further hone the design of the application, I have used two cases of custom CSS: in-component styles and a CSS file imported directly into the `index.html` file.
