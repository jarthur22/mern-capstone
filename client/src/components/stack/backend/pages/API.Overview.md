### Overview of the CRUD REST API

#### So what even is an API?

An API is the middleman between the backend and frontend, fielding requests and serving up data from the database. It is accessible through a URL, just like a website, so it can also be made to be accessed by other projects!

#### What is "REST"?

Basically, REST is the standard. It stands for Representational State Transfer, but that's not important. What IS important is that it is more friendly than other API architectures.

#### What is "CRUD"?

Its not a slur! It stands for " Create, Read, Update, Delete", because these are the four basic operations that a CRUD API performs on the database. Create objects in the DB, read them and serve them to the client, update them when data needs to be changed, and delete them as necessary to free up space.
